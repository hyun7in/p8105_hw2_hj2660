## Problem 1

Clean the data in pols-month.csv. There are months when Ford became
president following Nixon, during which the ‘prez_gop’ variable is 2. We
can reassign these cases to be coded as ‘gop,’ which is consistent with
months when ‘prez_gop’ is 1. This ensures that the ‘president’ variable
maintains consistency in labeling the political affiliation, regardless
of the transition between Nixon and Ford.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |>
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.integer(month)]) |>
  mutate(president = recode(prez_gop, "0" =  "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) |>
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

Clean the data in snp.csv, and to ensure the year is in four digits, we
can use ‘if_else’.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |>
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) |>
  select(year, month, everything()) |>
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.integer(month)]) |>
  mutate(year = if_else(year >= 50, 1900 + year, 2000 + year)) |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) |>
  select(year, month, close)
```

Tidy data in unemployment.csv and change from ‘wide’ to ‘long’ format so
that it can be merged with the other two datasets.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |>
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Join the datasets by merging pols_df, snap_df, and unemployment_df

``` r
data = 
  left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) |>
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))

str(data)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    822 obs. of  11 variables:
    ##  $ year        : int  1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr  "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
    ##  $ gov_gop     : int  23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_gop     : int  51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
    ##  $ rep_gop     : int  253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
    ##  $ gov_dem     : int  23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_dem     : int  45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
    ##  $ rep_dem     : int  198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
    ##  $ president   : chr  "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
    ##  $ close       : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

The `pols_df` has 822 observations and 9 variables and tells about the
party affiliation distribution of national politicians from 1947 to
2015. The `snp_df` has 787 observations and 3 variables, ranging from
years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment_df` has 816 observations and 3
variables, covering the years from 1948 to 2015. The average
unemployment rate for January, starting in the year 1975, during months
when the president is a Democrat, is 6.57%. The average unemployment
rate for Republicans over the same time period was 6.47%. Missing values
in the ‘close’ and ‘unemployment’ variables have been replaced with ‘NA’
values.

## Problem 2

Clean and organize the dataset for Mr. Trash Wheel.

``` r
MrTrashWheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./Trash_Wheel/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |>
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) 
```

Clean and organize the dataset for Professor Trash Wheel.

``` r
ProfTrashWheel_df =
  readxl::read_excel("./Trash_Wheel/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Clean and organize the dataset for Gwynnda Trash Wheel.

``` r
GwynTrashWheel_df =
  readxl::read_excel("./Trash_Wheel/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:K157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |>
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

While combining three datasets, an error occurred, indicating that there
was a data type mismatch between the ‘year’ columns, with one being of
type ‘character’ and the other of type ‘double.’ To resolve this issue,
the ‘year’ column in each dataset was uniformly converted to the
‘character’ data type. Additionally, a ‘trash_wheel’ column was
introduced in each dataset to specify the corresponding Trash Wheel.

``` r
combined_df = 
  bind_rows(MrTrashWheel_df, ProfTrashWheel_df, GwynTrashWheel_df)
```

The `MrTrashWheel_df` has 584 observations and 15 variables. The
`ProfTrashWheel_df` has 106 observations and 14 variables. The
`GwynTrashWheel_df` has 155 observations and 13 variables. The total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26. The total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 16300.
